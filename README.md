#  Simple_Blockchain
### In this Repo, I have shown a basic Implementation of Blockchain using JavaScript.

## Initial
To start with I have **created a Genesis Block and other blocks to be added** to it later.

## Intermediate
The Blocks are connected by a **unique hash**. 
Each subsequent block has a hash of the previous block along with its own hash.
### The hashing has been done using **SHA-256 Hashing Algorithm.** 
SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that outputs a value that is 256 bits long.

## Final
All the blocks are chained together to create a **BLOCKCHAIN.**


**`Apart from making chain, a function to check the validity of the chain has also been added.`**
